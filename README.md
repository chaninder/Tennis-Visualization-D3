# Tennis-Visualization-D3

This visualization project takes us to a deep dive into ATP tennis. Using d3.js visualizations, we see how various aspects of the game has changed over the years. Rather than explaining the details of this project, I recorded a video of final result. You can view it here: https://youtu.be/Arr51AhTVoY.
